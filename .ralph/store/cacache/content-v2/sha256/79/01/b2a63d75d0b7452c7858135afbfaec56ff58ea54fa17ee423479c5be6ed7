Completed 3 testing tasks in iteration #56. Found that unit tests for session store and template rendering already existed with good coverage (85.2% and 68.6% respectively). Added new integration tests for iteration loop covering session resumption, session_complete handling, and state tracking. Improved orchestrator test coverage from 33.0% to 38.6%. All tests pass.
